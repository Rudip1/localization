## Project Overview

This project presents a pose-based Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) SLAM system using laser scan matching with the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm. The method is designed for mobile robots operating in indoor environments and is validated in both simulation (RViz and Stonefish) and real-world TurtleBot platforms. The system fuses odometry and IMU data for prediction and corrects the robot pose using LIDAR-based ICP registration. Experimental results demonstrate accurate localization and consistent mapping under realistic conditions.
